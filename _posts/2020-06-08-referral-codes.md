A referral code is a unique code assigned to your account. You can use this code to refer your friends to Dong Chinese and get rewarded. When you refer a friend to Dong Chinese, both of you will get a 20% discount on all of your future payments.

There are 4 referral tiers. You will get a higher discount based on how many people use your code to subscribe to one of our paid plans.

|        | Referrals |   Discount   |
|-------:|:---------:|:------------:|
| Tier 1 |    1-2    |    20% off   |
| Tier 2 |    3-5    |    33% off   |
| Tier 3 |    6-9    |    50% off   |
| Tier 4 |    10+    | Free account |

### Example

If 7 people subscribe with your promo code, you will get 50% off all of your future payments. Once 10 people subscribe with your promo code, you will get a free subscription.

**Referral numbers do not expire**, so you do not have to worry that you will get a smaller discount if your purchase a yearly plan.
