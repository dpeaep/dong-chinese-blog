Recently I added a new feature to the [Dong Chinese dictionary](https://www.dong-chinese.com/dictionary) that shows examples sentences, media, and images for any word that you look up.

## Example sentences

At the top you will see sentences that contain the word you look up. You can tap on any word to see the pinyin and English definition. If you tap the speaker button it will read the sentence to you.

## Example media

Now that I have [audio synchronized with transcripts](https://blog.dong-chinese.com/2020/04/21/matching-Chinese-audio-to-transcripts.html), it is possible to extract clips of media containing words that you are looking for. If you tap "Play media", it will go to the exact part of the video or audio that contains a sentence using the word. If you like, you can then tap "Watch more" to watch the whole video.

## Example images

This part already existed before, but I improved the filtering of images so that the examples shown would be less repetitive.
