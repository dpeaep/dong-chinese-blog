Most people ask the same question when I first show them [Dong Chinese](https://www.dong-chinese.com). There are two answers to that question. One is simple (but boring), and the other is complicated (but interesting!)

## Simple answer

**tl;dr: "Dong" means "understand".**

In Chinese, the name of Dong Chinese is 懂中文 (Dǒng Zhōngwén). The first word, 懂 (dǒng), means "understand". The second word, 中文 (zhōngwén), means "Chinese language". 

## Complicated answer

Autobiography time!

Once upon a time, a precious little baby boy was born to two American parents who were working at a university in 山**东** (Shān**dōng**) province. He first graced the world with his presence in January, right in the heart of 冬天 (**dōng**tiān) - the cold winter season. This momentous event took place in China's **东**方 (**dōng**fāng), that is, the easternmost region of China.

So they named him 盛华**东** (Shèng Huá**dōng**), since he was a magnificent (盛) little baby boy born in China (华), in the east (**东**).

For short, family and friends called him by the nickname **东东** (**Dōngdōng**), except his siblings, who quickly thought of less endearing ways to call their baby brother:

 - 小**动**物 (xiǎo **dòng**wù): Little animal
 - **东东**弟弟有大肚肚！ (**Dōngdōng** dìdi yǒu dà dùdu): Little brother Dongdong has a big tummy!

Little Dongdong left China as a baby and unfortunately didn't grow up understanding Chinese. But a couple decades later, once he graduated from university, he went back to his hometown for a few years so that he could finally **懂** (**dǒng**; understand) the language and culture that he had been missing for so long.

So, what does "dong" mean? For me it means lots of things. Let's count it all up:

1. 山东 (Shāndōng) - Shandong province
2. 冬天 (dōngtiān) - Winter
3. 东方 (dōngfāng) - East
4. 盛华东 (Shèng Huádōng) - My Chinese name
5. 动物 (dòngwù) - Animal
6. 懂 (dǒng) - Understand
    
    Oh, and last but not least:
    
7. [懂中文 (Dǒng Zhōngwén) - Dong Chinese](https://www.dong-chinese.com)
