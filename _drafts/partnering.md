Partner with Dong Chinese
For
 - Video and podcast creators
 - Bloggers and social media pages

Requirements
 - You have at least 20 videos or podcast episodes.
 - You have transcripts or subtitle files of your content
 - Your content is at least 80% Chinese. (e.g. not primarily English explanations of Chinese grammar or long English explanations of short dialogs or phrases in Chinese) 
How it works
 - Once your videos or podcasts are added to Dong Chinese, they will be listed on the media page and recommended on the home page to users who can understand them. Users will be able to tap on words to see the pinyin and English gloss. Unfamiliar words will be highlighted in yellow. Once they finish watching, they will see how this content expands their knowledge. They can also practice writing the text from your content.
 - Dong Chinese will keep track of how many users watch and favorite your content. You will get an "impact" score equal to the number of the views plus 20 times the number of favorites. Each month, $2 from each subscription is allocated to a pool of money to pay content creators. This money is divided among the creators in proportion to their impact score.
