## Why I started learning Chinese

I was born in Jinan, China. Both of my parents are American, and at the time my father was a professor at Shandong University.

My whole family moved back to the United States when I was still a 6-month-old infant. Growing up I didn't speak any Chinese. The extent of my knowledge in Chinese that I learned from my parents was [my name](https://blog.dong-chinese.com/dong-chinese-name), how to count from 1 to 10, and a [children's song about two strange tigers with various missing body parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rshE1d2RrPg).

I always had felt that since I was a Chinese baby, I should know more about China and be able to speak Chinese. Before my last semester of university, when I was trying to figure out what my future career would look like, I decided that I would like to return to China once I graduated. My parents got in touch with their close Chinese friends that they had known from 20 years earlier. Their son, who was once an 11-year-old boy learning English from my father, was now a grown man with a Ph. D. working at a research and development laboratory at a large tech company. 

He invited me to come to China, live in his apartment, and start working at his company. I exitedly accepted his offer. To get prepared for moving to China, I enrolled in a beginner Chinese course at my last semester of university.

## How I learned Chinese

At university I studied fairly dilligently. Since I was planning to move to China in a few months, I had more pressing motivation than the most of the other students, and I also had more time since I only had two other classes I was required to take that semester. I did all of the assignments that the professor suggested, and I had extra private lessons with tutors a few times a week.

Even so, there's only so much one can learn in a semester of university classes. When I arrived in China that summer I still felt like a stupid American, unable to converse with anyone in Chinese beyond a simple introduction. Most of my communication was with people who could speak English.

Every day I rode a bus to work for 40 minutes each way. Since there was nothing else to while sitting on the bus, I studied vocabulary flashcards on Pleco and Skritter. During lunchbreak I often chatted with my coworkers, mostly in English, but with a few tidbits of Chinese here and there. Over the months I gradually improved, but after 6 months living in China I still didn't feel particularly confident in conversation.

At the beginning of 2016, after I had been in China for six months and not being satisfied with my level, I decided that I would try to not speak any English for one month, except sometimes at work when necessary. This didn't immediately change my level, but it did quickly change my habits and level of confidence. Doing this challenge for a month forced me to respond in Chinese even if someone spoke to me in English. When strangers spoke to me in English, I told them in Chinese that I was Russian and didn't understand English.

Two things changed for me after this one month challenge. Firstly, instead of feeling nervous or embarrased about speaking Chinese, I started to see it as just a usual part of my life. Secondly, it forced me into the habit of using Chinese whenever possible, instead of using English whenever possible. I don't have any objective measure of my progress before and after this point, but subjectively it felt that my rate of progress increased significantly after this point.
